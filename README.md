This a Next.JS app using Stripe for integrating Payment and using Sanity for Content Management System.

Steps to Create the App:
Create the required pages, components, assets, and styles as usual.

To insert icons, use npm install react-icons and then import the desired icons correctly in the file. Choose icons from the React Icons library.

To connect SCSS (Sass) files to JSX, use npm install sass.

To play a video in the background, use the following code:

jsx
Copy code
<video src={video} muted autoPlay loop type="video/mp4"></video>
For animation effects in text, import AOS:

jsx
Copy code
import Aos from "aos";
import "aos/dist/aos.css";

useEffect(() => {
  Aos.init({ duration: 2000 });
}, []);
To use yarn and install the dependencies, install yarn with npm install yarn and then use yarn to install dependencies.

To start the development server, run yarn dev.

Install Next.js globally using npm install -g next.

To use module CSS, follow Next.js's built-in CSS Modules.

To use images with Next.js, import Image from "next/image".

To use icons, make sure to use curly braces while importing.

To use both global CSS and module CSS for the same element, make use of CSS cascading and specificity.

To create Sanity, create a folder named "sanity," and in the terminal, initialize Sanity with sanity init.

If the installation hangs, press Ctrl + C and manually install the dependencies by running yarn.

To start Sanity, run yarn dev.

Configure Sanity Studio and define the content structure as required.

Connect Sanity Studio with Visual Studio Code by creating a "lib" folder and a "client.js" file. Install the required dependencies using npm install @sanity/client.

Get a Sanity token by navigating to Settings > API > Tokens and generate one.

Use the Sanity token to fetch data from the browser by installing another dependency: npm install @sanity/image-url.

Utilize Zustand for state management.

For online payment, integrate Stripe. Log in to Stripe, turn on test mode, provide a business name, navigate to Developers > API Keys, and copy the secret key.

Deployment:
To deploy Sanity, first stop running it.

Deploy the Next.js application using Vercel or other platforms of your choice.
